         <p style="width:80%; margin-left:120px;"> Smart Cities Mission was launched by the Hon’ Prime Minister on 25 June, 2015. The main objective of the Mission is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure, clean and sustainable environment and give a decent quality of life to their citizens through the application of ‘smart solutions’. The Mission aims to drive economic growth and improve quality of life through comprehensive work on social, economic, physical and institutional pillars of the city. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development by creation of replicable models which act as lighthouses to other aspiring cities. 100 cities have been selected to be 
             developed as Smart Cities through a two-stage competition.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center; margin-left:100px; margin-top:50px;color: cornflowerblue;">Vision </h2>
        <p style="width:80%; margin-left:120px;"> as a global economic power. Digital India, E-governance and 'Make in India' initiatives have brought the necessary impetus to the industry and economic growth. As a result India is witnessing a massive shift towards urbanisation.
            Today, nearly 40% of India's population is living in the cities and is on a rise due to constant influx. The severity of the situation is such that by 2022 it is estimated that
             shortage of urban housing will reach nearly 34.1 million units.</p>
